        <h2>Freya The goddess of love and beauty</h2>
        
        <p>Freya as a goddess of beauty and love you think of her of a nice person who gennerally doesnt want to hurt anyone well you wrong so be prepare for what you about to hear Freya is the goddess of the Freya Familia the strongest familia in the current timeline despite being a goddess of love she is quite ruthless meaning if she hads eyes on you its best to accept it because unless your higher than level 7 than theres no point of even fighting it and plus the fact she doesnt need to send her best men after you instead she used her ability known as Charm As a Goddess of Beauty, Freya is able to charm Gods, mortals and even monsters, dead or alive, with her beauty. In addition, she can even overwrite the charms of other Goddesses of Beauty, such as when she charmed Tammuz Belili, who had already been charmed by Ishtar. The area of effect is huge as she enveloped the whole of Orario with it. She is said to be able to take over the entire mortal realm if she ever so chooses. Through her Charm Freya is able to accomplish a wide variety of effects. Any person affected will follow her orders blindly and do anything to please her or gain her favor, even if it means killing themselves. She is also capable of overwhelming a person's senses with ecstasy and pleasure to render them unconscious, leaving them in a trance. Most impressive, Freya can even rewrite a target's memories, erasing real ones as well as being able to create new ones. Only two people have been shown to be able to resist it; Bell thanks to his skill Liaris Freese and Hestia due to being one of the three Virgin Goddess. Even then, Hermes noted that Hestia would have fallen prey to it if she didn't unleash her divinity as much as possible. </p>

            <p> she allow other Familias to join the war game in order to give hestia a fighting chance that the war game is hide and seek to make things fair that said over 800 people from 47 familias join the hestia familia in the war game against the Freya Familia. PS theres alot of information about the war game too much to add so i only mention the important parts Bell met Ottar and is getting constantly beat down while majority of the ailiance of the hestia familia defeated by the Freya Familia higher ups then Freya orders her familia members to end the war immediately. A group led by Allen head towards where the gods of the allied forces are located. If the gods get their flowers taken, their familia members are automatically eliminated from the war game. Hephaistos and Hestia are the only familias in the allied forces that have Lv5 members, and if both are eliminated they have no chance of winning. Since Tsubaki has already fallen, Hephaistos acts as decoy for Hestia to escape. Takemikazuchi eventually gets his flower taken but not before taking down 21 enemies. Those of the goddess alliance sacrificed themselves to allow their leader Hathor escape. The names of the familias eliminated are being announced fast which include Magni, Modi, Ogma, Serket, Soma, Hephaistos, Takemikazuchi, Dellingr, Ratri and Hephaistos. Of the 46 familias in the alliance, only 4 are remaining. and then an act of hope happen as Hogni who destory the front line of forces in the ailiance fight against Ryuu a level 6 who equals him in power they face in a ferice dual but it was reveal most of Hogni power was drain when he was destorying the front line which mark Ryuu victory over him giving the hestia familia hope in the war game then when Heith treid to heal Hogni she was back stabb by Hedin who strike her down by his lighting what he saids to save the goddess freya he then attack ottar along with bell ryuu and mama mia The Gulliver Brothers all go unconscious after being hit with numerous attacks and a powerful debuff </p>
