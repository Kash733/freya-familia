        <h2>Freya The goddess of love and beauty</h2>
        
        <p>Freya as a goddess of beauty and love you think of her of a nice person who gennerally doesnt want to hurt anyone well you wrong so be prepare for what you about to hear Freya is the goddess of the Freya Familia the strongest familia in the current timeline despite being a goddess of love she is quite ruthless meaning if she hads eyes on you its best to accept it because unless your higher than level 7 than theres no point of even fighting it and plus the fact she doesnt need to send her best men after you instead she used her ability known as Charm As a Goddess of Beauty, Freya is able to charm Gods, mortals and even monsters, dead or alive, with her beauty. In addition, she can even overwrite the charms of other Goddesses of Beauty, such as when she charmed Tammuz Belili, who had already been charmed by Ishtar. The area of effect is huge as she enveloped the whole of Orario with it. She is said to be able to take over the entire mortal realm if she ever so chooses. Through her Charm Freya is able to accomplish a wide variety of effects. Any person affected will follow her orders blindly and do anything to please her or gain her favor, even if it means killing themselves. She is also capable of overwhelming a person's senses with ecstasy and pleasure to render them unconscious, leaving them in a trance. Most impressive, Freya can even rewrite a target's memories, erasing real ones as well as being able to create new ones. Only two people have been shown to be able to resist it; Bell thanks to his skill Liaris Freese and Hestia due to being one of the three Virgin Goddess. Even then, Hermes noted that Hestia would have fallen prey to it if she didn't unleash her divinity as much as possible. </p>
