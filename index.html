        <h1>The Freya Familia</h1> <img src="images/Freyaimage.png" alt="">
            <h2>Introducing the Freya Familia</h2> 
            <p>The Freya Familia was known to be the stongest familia in the mortal world with its most powerful and skillful members with The Gulliver Brothers Best Teamwork in the story with Allen being the fastest Hogni and Hedin The best magic swordsman and ottar the only level 7 and to explain the world the world until their defeat in the faction war which cause the disband for their familia but when their familia was alive they were the ultimate power house and their Goddess is Freya The Goddess of beauty <a href="https://danmachi.fandom.com/wiki/Freya" target="_blank">dangerous Goddess</a> on There world. The Freya Familia is known to be the worlds current strongest Familia ever exist even disbanded their reign still lives on <a target="_blank" href="https://danmachi.fandom.com/wiki/Freya_Familia">the most things noted for is There Wrath</a>. You would think that they would be tough survivors, but you would be wrong.</p> 

            <h1>The World Itself</h1>
            <p>Danmachi the world is full with humans monsters and gods in short a familia myth in order to explain the story so the world was in a brink of destrustion the gods watching from above all traveled down to the mortal world to aid the humans against the monsters to do that they gave humans a falna a the grace, sometimes called blessing, given by Gods and Goddesses to their familia members  evenutally the gods found the home of the monsters call the dungeon where monsters are created and travled up the 2 gods Ouranos and Zeus founded orario or known as the Labyrinth City and just so you know the gods you hear in the story are from actual greek and norse mythology so in the story for Freya she came to the mortal world after being bored up in heavan due to finding no one that she can actually loved so she and her familia travled around the world and made it to orario and the 2 strongest Familias at this time was the Zeus and Hera Familias who ruled with the most power that said Zeus and hera was tasked to complete the 3 great quest where powerful monsters escape the dungeon and is currently destorying and ruining the world so zeus was cautious and saw Freya someone who can take their place should him and hera familia fall so Zeus ask Hera to make Freya stay so Hera delcare a war game against Freya and won and force her to stay in orario for the rest of her life making Freya to Hate Zeus and Hera so Ottar when he was young would try to fight and beat the zeus and hera familia but will constanlaty get destoryed by the members of zeus and hera but evenutally Ottarl at level 6 beaten a Former Zeus Familia member Zald a level 7 and after ottarl did he become the only level 7 but what after to the zeus and hera familia well they killed both the Behemoth and the Leviathan, but lost their battle against the One Eyed Black Dragon, losing their main force. Because of this, they were weakened and Zeus was ultimately banished from Orario by Freya and Loki, who were their rivals at the time, in order to maintain order in the city. to finish off the main power that a person in familia has depends on their level and stats which are Strength Endurance Dexterity Agility Magic and you can raise your stats by doing the stats to explain if you want to raise your endurance you got get hit a bunch of times and if you want to get raise your agility just run the number of the stats are simply these I  0-99 H  100-199 G  200-299 F  300-399 E  400-499 D  500-599 C  600-699 B  700-799 A  800-899 S  900-999 SS  1,000-1,099 SSS  1,100+ but depending on your level the stats can get harder to obtain like if you level 6 and wanted to get your endurance up it be harder and slower just get that stat up while the level itself can make someone level powerful such as Bell cranel someone who can raise his stats up to the triple SSS something no one in the entire danmachi universe cant do so hes very higher end level 1 which means for those who dont know someone with their stats either on A b or S on their level but back to what i ment so the leveling makes someone below that level stronger then them so lets say this if Bell a level 1 has all of his stats on SSS which makes him stronger fighting against a level 2 then you think bell will win but no, No matter what if someone a higher level then you then the level 2 person will win even if their stats are terrible thats why the Freya Familia is very strong with someone like ottar he can just beat and defeat any level 6 below him making him a powerful foe not to be mess with and witht the other members like the gulliver brothers level 5 but together a level 6 and hogni and hedin and allen being level 6 then the familia is just a military type of Familia </p>

            <h2>How the Freya Familia become the strongest</h2>
    
            <p>it was because of their surpeior power where everyday normal members either level 2 3 or rarely level 4s fight each other in a battle royal to the death with that it imrpoves all of their stats and not only there members but there exeucitives the gulliver brothers level 5 hedin hogni and Allen level 6 and ottar the only level 7 and the power house of the familia but even without Ottar they still a powerful group so Besides him, their main force consists of Allen hailed as the fastest in the city Hedin and Hogni famed as the most brutal magic swordsmen and the Gulliver Brothers renowned for having the best teamwork in Orario</p>
