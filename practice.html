            <h1>Power</h1>
            <p>Before their official dissolution, the Freya Familia were generally feared as the most powerful Familia in Orario, having many high-level adventurers, including the, at the time, only Level 7 adventurer, Ottar, as a member. Their captain's might was best exemplified in the Great Faction War, where he demonstrated the ability to achieve Level 8 prowess with his skill Vana Arganture, requiring the combined efforts of three pseudo Level 7s and a pseudo Level 6 just to leave him out of combat for five minutes.

                Before announcing his and his fellow top executives' rank ups to Level 7, Finn acknowledged that Ottar made it impossible for the Loki Familia, Orario's second strongest faction, to win against the Freya Familia. Furthermore, while Loki believed the Boaz to no longer be a big deal after her top three members reached Level 7, Finn speculated that he will soon rank up. </p>

            <p>Besides him, their main force consists of Allen, hailed as the fastest in the city; Hedin and Hogni, famed as the most brutal magic swordsmen; and the Gulliver Brothers, renowned for having the best teamwork in Orario. The majority of the other over 100 members are Level 2 or 3. At least fifty of all of the members are second class adventurers and they alone make up a force equivalent to around 20 middle-ranking Familias. Bell noted that the einhenjars are far stronger than adventurers of the same level from other Familias and, due to their training method, they have also developed high levels of endurance and stamina</p>

            <p>Though not a combatant, Heith is also a great fighting asset. Thanks to her skills as a healer, second in the entire world only to Airmid's, she can continuously bring back the einhenjars to full health in the middle of a battle within mere moments, essentially turning them into an army of "undying" warriors. In a war game between the Loki Familia and the Freya Familia, the Andhr√≠mnir has the potential to secure victory for their side. </p>

            <p>Though they have been known to explore the dungeon, reaching as far as the 58th Floor, the Freya Familia's lack of cooperation makes expeditions difficult, with the last one ending in failure after all the executives began fighting each other. Instead, their main training method are death matches which they refer to as "baptism". Due to their hatred for each other, they face each other in battles to the death from sunrise to sunset.

                Back when they had a base, they fought in its large garden in a barbaric free-for-all where everyone sought a new opponent the moment they defeated their current one. In spite of resorting to such a brutal method, the Familia could keep it up without suffering even a single casualty thanks to their amazing medical team. Heith, in fact, is capable of taking care of all the injured if she so wishes. Since their official dissolution, they have moved to training in the dungeon</p>

            <p>Following their hellish training, the members used to gather in their home's dining hall, where they ate from a great feast in order to have the energy needed for the next day's training.

                This custom was adopted by members preceding Ottar and his generation. The only combatants not allowed to fight are the executives of the Familia. Due to their power, the loss of even one of them would be severely detrimental to the faction and his defeat would give other Familias an opportunity to take advantage of. This is why duels between executives at their base were forbidden. However, it was shown that there is no problem with them fighting in the dungeon when the rest of the executives once took advantage of Ottar going on an expedition to fight him.</p>
